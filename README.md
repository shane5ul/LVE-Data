# LVE-Data
Linear viscoelastic data (SAOS) for entangled linear and branched polymers as plain text files.

This repository contains experimental data shared by the authors of the original paper or acquired by digitizing data from papers.

It includes the rheology of relatively monodisperse linear, star, H, and comb polymers.

It also includes binary blends of linear and star polymers (linear-linear, star-linear, and star-star).

Each subfolder refers to a particular paper. It has a `header` file that contains information specific to the dataset. The `clean/` directory houses the data.
